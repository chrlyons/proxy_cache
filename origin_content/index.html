  <h1>Welcome to Our Docker-Based Environment</h1>
  <p>
    This is a sample page served by our Python HTTP server,
    cached by Varnish (simulating an Akamai-like CDN),
    and optionally routed through a forward proxy (Squid).
  </p>
  <p>
    Try refreshing this page a few times to see the caching behavior
    (e.g., <code>X-Cache: MISS</code> on first load, then <code>HIT</code>).

  <p><em>Happy caching!</em></p>
